My corpus will be my own playlist called Kasper Hardstyle/core.
It is a playlist that is a subbranch of my main playlist.
It has all the songs from my main playlist that fall within the following genres: Hardstyle, Hardcore, Frenchcore.
The reason this is interesting is because it is a very diverse slice of music from very specific genres.
This could give me an opportunity to learn more about these genres.
Things I for example expect are that I will see significant BPM changes between the three genres.
But also listener data will be interesting.
I expect Hardcore to have older listeners than Hardstyle.
My playlist does have a bit of a gap when it comes to the more melodic artists in these genres.
Especially the newer songs that come out.
Some very typical tracks are: Trouble - D-block $ S-Te-Fan, Our Church - Headhunterz.
An atypical track is Like a drug - Unproven.
